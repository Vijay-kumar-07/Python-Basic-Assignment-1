    "Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) __getitem__ or __iter__. In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use __iter__ first, which returns an object that supports the iteration protocol with a __next__ method: if no __iter__ is found by inheritance search, Python falls back on the __getitem__ indexing method, which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes. If used, the yield statement can create __next__ method automatically."

That is,__repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user-friendly displays; __repr__ gives extra details or the object's as-code form."
